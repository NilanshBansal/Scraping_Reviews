1,Varshaa Ashish,95 Reviews,550 Followers,2018-04-13 12:37:26,Rated 3.5,"Unlike the whole hype around it, I found Bukhara okayish! Firstly, their seating was so uncomfortable (back less and stool format) so that was a big no. Besides that, food was a bit too oily for our taste. We did try the famous Dal Bukhara too but like I said that wasn't anything out of the world either. The only thing I really loved were their prawns...the preparation, marination, everything was perfect and they smelled real good too. Their HUGE Naan is a definite photo-prop, so overall not the first place I'd go to if I had a special celebration planned!"
2,Aadit Sharma,23 Reviews,60 Followers,2018-04-10 18:26:43,Rated 5.0,"living up to it's name! probably the best dal makhni I've ever had in Delhi, although we had a waiting time of 25 minutes but I can surely say that it was worth it. Everything from the decor , interiors , staff to the food was brilliant. the most amazing thing there is the big naan that they serve . It is a must have for everyone to try it atleast once. We were 3 people and we shared that one big naan. Amazing!!!"
3,Kanika Kashyap,55 Reviews,187 Followers,2018-04-10 11:43:01,Rated 5.0,"Finally went to this place after hearing so much about it. On entering you see low height tables and stools with brass cutlery, giving out the vibe of an old village restaurant. Loved their Dal Bukhara, it's a must try. Moving on to non-veg, I had their mugh malai kebab, which just melted in my mouth. The service was nothing short of perfection."
4,Shrey Agarwal,24 Reviews,84 Followers,2018-04-08 00:13:38,Rated 5.0,"Finally went to this place after listening heaps of praises about the quality of food they offer and I must say the place didn’t disappoint at all. Although Had to wait for an hour before we could get a table, but I guess the wait for worth the while."
5,Shubham Aggarwal,35 Reviews,110 Followers,2018-04-01 11:02:55,Rated 5.0,"I went there last weekend with a bunch of friends on recommendation and reviews, as expected the ambiance of Bukhara was just mind blowing, so authentic it was. Coming to Food Dal Bukhara is their USP along with Nan Bukhara and it exceeded our expectations(talking only Veg coz I am Vegetarian and yes my friends also liked the non vegetarian food that they ordered). I would definitely come back soon and would recommend my near and dear once to come and enjoy the food."

10,Mohit Sharma,34 Reviews,216 Followers,2018-03-22 15:19:40,Rated 3.0,When I got tired of listening that Bukhara Dal is God’s made dal. I went to Bukhara and while it was not bad. It was not something that made me jump from my seat. I also ordered mutton and The giant nan. Overall an average experience and nothing to be in aww of.

12,Gursharan Chana,122 Reviews,33 Followers,2018-03-12,Rated 4.5,Great kebabs served with giant naan breads!.....now that' a great combo. This place is a meat lovers paradise. Kebabs have been marinated in various recipes and are all delicious. The Dal Makhani is also very tasty.
13,Mudit Sharma,46 Reviews,167 Followers,2018-03-10,Rated 5.0,I love this place no doubt this is one of the finest place in delhi if you are looking amazing Dal Makhani and Naan or some chicken items then this is place to visit. i visited this place so many times its great. but there Pineapple raita is not good at all its like they put some slice on Dahi they didn't put efforts to convert it into raita.
14,Purav Gandhi,188 Reviews,900 Followers,2018-03-09,Rated 5.0,"One of the best North Indian food you will have ever!!! Dal Bukhara and the breads are to die for, must have every time you visit. Desserts are also quite decent."
15,Srivar Harlalka,86 Reviews,249 Followers,2018-03-08,Rated 5.0,"Bukhara at ITC Maurya has got to be the best North Indian restaurant in the country. The highlight of this place being the Dal Bukhara which is made over 48 hours cooked with loads of butter and ghee. Apart from the dal, all the Tandoori items are top notch and the rotis are crisp and absolutely cooked to perfection."
16,Vasudha Gupta,101 Reviews,288 Followers,2018-03-07,Rated 4.5,Looking for some exquisite North Indian? Or scrumptious Dal Makhni to be specific? Bukhara is the place to go. It has always been a favorite and will always be.
17,Pooja Mehra,41 Reviews,268 Followers,2018-03-04,Rated 4.5,I love this restaurant. Certainly will come back again for delicious yummy food. Love the desert too. I dont mind to queue but worth to wait.
18,Tanya Sirohi,47 Reviews,395 Followers,2018-03-03,Rated 4.5,"This was my third trip to Bukhara in New Delhi and it did not disappoint. We always do the tasting menu, which gives you an excellent selection of Indian cuisine from different regions and styles. Food is absolutely delicious and prepared to perfection. They surprised us with a cake for our colleagues birthday which, when presented, was a cultural experience in and of itself. Warning: there are no utensils used - and food is served family style, which makes the experience fun and different, but if you aren’t into that, then this isn’t the place for you. Their signature dal (slow cooked for 24 hours) is the best I’ve ever had. Excellent cocktail and liquor selections as well. My favorite meal in New Delhi."

25,Rohit,49 Reviews,445 Followers,2018-02-25,Rated 5.0,Visited Bukhara at ITC Maurya Sheraton after a long time. Bukhara serves cuisine of North West Frontier Province. Ordered the legendary dal Bukhara and Peshawari Raan which were awesome. Full marks to Bukhara and is a must visit.

27,Family On The Wheels,71 Reviews,1173 Followers,2018-02-21,Rated 5.0,I had expected to be disappointed by Bukhara as the most exalted places can sometimes be a let-down.
28,Fakhria2012,92 Reviews,154 Followers,2018-02-19,Rated 4.5,"One of the most accepted restaurant among not only domestic food lovers but among international food lovers as well offers the best kebabs and Naans while other dishes equally up to expectations, lively ambiance with effective service , always want to visit again as it’s different from all other restaurants."
29,Shalini,39 Reviews,104 Followers,2018-02-12,Rated 4.5,"The place is beautiful and expensive. I will certainly take my future mother in law there to flatter her with the desi flavour. Well, the place is great to taste some desi flavour with some real good options in alcohol."

33,Apoorv Mittal,17 Reviews,107 Followers,2018-01-26,Rated 5.0,"The famous Bukhara is worth at least one visit when you are in Delhi. They have some of the best North West Frontier cuisines on offer. We always have the standard Naan ( Butter ) Murgh Malai Kabab (chicken), Sheekh Kabab (minced lamb\/Goat) all cooked in Tandoor which is an Oven. Add to it Bukhara Dal and you have a great meal. There are other great choices Sikandari Raan is a must, but you need to have a good appetite but everything on the menu can be shared. The service is excellent and a meal to remember."

36,Sherbir Panag,31 Reviews,437 Followers,2018-01-14,Rated 5.0,"Bukhara is a New Delhi institution and one of my top picks in the city to celebrate or entertain. Himanshu and his team do an excellent job at service and keeping the affair homely. I must confess I did have one bad experience several months later, but the finesse with which the team resolved my issues is testament to their humility, not withstanding the restaurant prestige."
37,Kritik Sharma,15 Reviews,210 Followers,2018-01-09,Rated 5.0,Definitely a best place to take out someone out to impress because this may be expensive but gives you a total rich feel.

41,Namrata,62 Reviews,102 Followers,2017-12-31,Rated 5.0,The best place to dine out in delhi. It is very famous for its dal bukhara and butter chicken and family naaan. A must must recommended place.

44,Mahtosh Mahtosh,24 Reviews,255 Followers,2017-12-29,Rated 5.0,"Famous for its Dal Bukhara, a place with reasonable pricing considering its setup and running cost. I have visited it a few times earlier too. No doubts, the Bukhara Dal, for which it is famous is excellent (5\/5), but other items which we have tried so far are just okayish type. A few reviewers have complained in their reviews that it is an overpriced or highly overpriced restaurant. But for me, such kind of restaurants is visited not just for food. These restaurants have a different class of its own. If we are only comparing what we spend and what we ate, then we are at the wrong foot. For cheaper options, and for a complete value for money (considering just food), old Delhi’s lanes are the ideal places. Each place has its own unique way of serving food, arrangement of seats, ambience, etc. So, stools are ok too. There is a restaurant in Cyber City, Gurgaon, named as Dhaba By Claridges that provides an ambience of a roadside dhaba, though the visitors are from the corporate. It is their own style, and people love it. Another restaurant, Aiwan e Shahi, that too situated in Cyber City, Gurgaon, has a very decent and sober ambience and interiors, perfect for Mughlai dining experience. I want to add that Aiwan e Shahi has a rare collection of a few Mughlai recipes in its pure form, and each of their items are out-of-the-world ones. They do not serve onions and chutneys with most of the items, and also discourages soft-drinks. It is their own style that majority of people are appreciating and loving, and are being addicted to that purity."
45,Woofer,35 Reviews,839 Followers,2017-12-28,Rated 5.0,"Does this place needs a review really? Hahahaha. Bt Zomato walo ke sath b to time pass karna hai. A perfect aatma tript karne wala food u get here keeping the stars of the ITC and the paisa in ur mind and pocket. Amazing reshami chicken tikka i had. Portion size is more than sufficient for two people. And then THE DAL BUKHARA oh my my, it is something which i can say that tummy bhar jaega bt niyat nahi bharegi with there crispy butter naan. The concept of eating with hands only and not with fork, knife or spoon has its own taste. Oye hoye maja he aa gaya sahab ji. Bt keep ur reservations timely."
46,Vritti Malhotra,50 Reviews,151 Followers,2017-12-26,Rated 5.0,One of the best rated restaurant in Delhi since all these years. And the famous dal Bukhara is mouth relishing. For the non veg lovers try out the tandoori chicken along with it
47,Mudit Gupta,192 Reviews,1482 Followers,2017-12-16,Rated 4.5,"Well it's the 100th review and I should make it special, so I decided to put the legendary restaurant to test."
48,Amanat Rao,43 Reviews,600 Followers,2017-12-15,Rated 5.0,"One of the best places to splurge in Delhi, even though it is a little over-hyped. The food is excellent. Dal Bukhara, Barrah Kabab and Naan Bukhara is what we had. The seating is a bit uncomfortable, but the overall ambiance is excellent. I call the place over-hyped because I've had equivalent and many a times better food with better ambiance at one fourth of the cost."
49,Hemant Singla,36 Reviews,500 Followers,2017-12-11,Rated 2.5,Disappointed...!!! The over hyped “Dal Bukhara” was not even close to the expectations what we had while ordering. I had much better versions of dal than that i tried at Bukhara. The portions were small and over priced. The expensive food is to be expected as you are in a 5 star but it failed to satisfy our taste buds also. We also ordered “Kasturi Kebab” which was also a failure to our expectation.
50,Rahul,268 Reviews,1733 Followers,2017-12-10,Rated 5.0,Its not often I dine at a 5 star restaurant and its far less often I repeat a 5 star restaurant. But Bukhara to me is that place which makes me come back again and again.
51,Soham Mukhopadhyay,35 Reviews,760 Followers,2017-12-04,Rated 5.0,"The food is good, but not something to rave about. The seating area is a little too cramped for my liking. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t feel comfortable through the dinner."
52,Bhukhadbabe,70 Reviews,524 Followers,2017-12-02,Rated 5.0,One of the finest food basically chicken I ever had till now. My experience here was tremendous. I loved that accient muglai theme. The best part is there service and that they everything in copper vessels.
53,Shorabh Biswas,92 Reviews,456 Followers,2017-12-02,Rated 4.5,Putting review for this restaurant is not right. Much cannot be wrote about this place as the restaurant standard is high among the rest and is best in its league. Little high in price but then you r in ITC Maurya.
54,Tania Swami,29 Reviews,551 Followers,2017-11-28,Rated 5.0,"One of the finest restaurants in asia rather , the food is out of the world . Dal bukhara or bureah kebab dahi ke kebab or the breads and phirni, ever dish is finger lucking good ,the ambience wooww . I can only say if you have not tasted the foud at bukhara you are missing on something super amazing in your life . A true heaven and feast to tast buds"
55,Prakhar Kumar,39 Reviews,79 Followers,2017-11-26,Rated 4.5,I visited this place as I was traveling for business and was told that this is one of the best places to have good food. When I first landed here felt the place to be a little cramped initially. Also was surprised that it had very few items on the menu though all sounded exotic. Though being a vegetarian did not had many options but was excited to see what is coming. And I must say that it was not disappointing at all. The food was satisfying not only to the taste buds but even to the soul. The giant Naan being the center of attraction was definitely good and for me was first time experience of breaking the naan and eating with a set of 9 other people.
56,Shobhit Kalra,141 Reviews,174 Followers,2017-11-23,Rated 4.5,"Heard a lot about the restaurant & their ""Dal Bukhara""....I tried the food but I didn't felt that there's anything very special in the food...The crew was good...The ambience portraits the history..I don't know why people were waiting outside the restaurant to pay more for that average taste food."
57,Gaurav Bansal,163 Reviews,394 Followers,2017-11-12,Rated 4.5,"I finally had the pleasure of dining at this favorite of Delhites and tourists alike.  While famous for its non-vegetarian kebabs, I was surprised to find that it is good for vegetarians too. Definitely a must do when in Delhi."
58,Raka Majumdar,72 Reviews,398 Followers,2017-11-12,Rated 5.0,"A restaurant dedicated to Indian cuisine can’t go wrong.. loved the raan, the meat just fell off the bone, dal bukhara was as good as they say and the giant naan was a show stopper. We had tandoori prawn which was decent along with chicken tikka"
59,Val86,30 Reviews,10 Followers,2017-11-07,Rated 5.0,"What an amazing restaurant! Definitely book in advance. Great attentive service, and loved the aprons to wear! Beautiful restaurant setting, and loved that you could see the chefs at work. Food was absolutely amazing in flavour, and the naan bread so beautifully flakey. Ask for the chicken khurchan - a secret dish not on the menu. Two mains, two naans, daal, two beers, a cocktail and a sprite came to $200AUD. Not cheap, but loved our visit and glad to say we’ve been."
60,Microspoon,7 Posts,571 Followers,2017-11-06,Rated 5.0,"I went here based on a friend’s recommendation. We organised to go through our hotel concierge, and he organised a taxi for us to the ITC Maurya. He did mention that Bukhara does not take bookings after 7.30pm so we may have to wait. It was a weeknight and we found Bukhara – there was no wait, so we were shown to our table immediately. The decor and feel reminded me of a cave in the desert. It was very cool."
